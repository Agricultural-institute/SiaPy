# Security Policy

Security is very important for SiaPy and its community. 🔒

Learn more about it below. 👇

## Versions

The latest version of SiaPy is supported.

You are encouraged to update your SiaPy version frequently. This way you will benefit from the latest features, bug fixes, and **security fixes**.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your cooperation in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

Please report any security vulnerabilities by emailing us at [janez.lapajne@kis.si](janez.lapajne@kis.si).

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report, assess it for validity and severity, and decide on the next steps. We ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it.

## What to include in your report

To help us triage and prioritize the issue, please include as much information as possible, such as:

- The version of our project you are using
- A step-by-step description of how to reproduce the vulnerability
- Any relevant logs or output
- Any other information you think might be relevant

## Public Discussions

Please refrain from publicly discussing a potential security vulnerability.

Discussing vulnerabilities in public forums before they are properly assessed and fixed can significantly increase the risk to the project and its users. It's better to discuss issues privately and work together to find a solution first, to limit the potential impact as much as possible. We appreciate your cooperation and understanding in handling sensitive matters with discretion.
